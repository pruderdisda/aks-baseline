However, MathType is not a free software and you need a license key to activate it. Some people may try to find a MathType v 6.7b keygen online, hoping to generate a valid serial number for the program. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons:
 
- Using a keygen is illegal and unethical. You are violating the intellectual property rights of the software developers and distributors. You are also exposing yourself to potential legal consequences.
- Using a keygen is risky and unsafe. You may download malware or viruses along with the keygen, which can harm your computer and compromise your data. You may also get a fake or invalid serial number that does not work or causes errors.
- Using a keygen is unnecessary and unwise. You can get MathType for a reasonable price from the official website or from authorized resellers. You can also try MathType for free for 30 days before buying it. You can benefit from the technical support, updates, and integrations that come with a legitimate license.

Therefore, we strongly advise you to avoid using a MathType v 6.7b keygen and instead purchase a genuine license from the WIRIS Store[^4^]. You will be able to create professional equations in your documents and presentations with ease and confidence.
